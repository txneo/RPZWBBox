# RPZWBBox
Raspberry Pi Zero W BBox
This is a port of the original BibleBox code to the Raspberry Pi Zero W device.
It provides download services for files stored on the device's SD card.
Added to the original code are mechanisms to change various operating parameters via clicks on the website.
It adds upload functionality to the download directory via WebDAV. This is intended to aid device owners in adding and updating files to be distributed. This function seems broken on Windows 10, but operates well on Linux (MacOS?).
